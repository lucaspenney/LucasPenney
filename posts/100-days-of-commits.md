100 Days of Commits
----

I started the year 2014 with the idea to see how long I could maintain a continuous GitHub commit streak. Admittedly at the time it seemed a little silly initially - number or frequency of commits certainly doesn't correlate with quality or progress in any project I've ever worked on, but there is a certain psychological effect of having a consistent 'feeling' of making progress. My thoughts on this were further validated in April when [John Resig posted about just such a thing](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/John).

Initially, this was a tough challenge. I had previously been working through problems more slowly, making a slew meaningful commits perhaps once every few days on my side projects. At first this change of pace was challenging to keep up (and the occasional approaching-midnight bugfix commits were made) but over time it became very rewarding, with a very clear increase in how productive I could be over a short period of time. On this first attempt, I had roughly 39 consecutive days of making commits.

It hadn't become a strong habit, but I started to understand why this sort of productivity tracking has it's own benefits and problems. There was an obvious increase in the amount of features and code I was able to produce in comparison with my previous work ethic. Conversely, I did find myself making more seemingly simple mistakes as time went on, and fatigue would eventually begin to deteriorate the quality of work I could produce. Ensuring that I had *something* to commit every day meant occasionally leaving small bugs for days that I might have been too busy to work on something larger, and trying to sneak in work past midnight on the days before I knew I wouldn't have time to work on something.

I didn't really have a number in mind of what I wanted my commit streak record to be, after my first attempt I was just trying to top my previous records, my eventual '0 days' often coming from simply poor planning of a day. Around August I had begun to get into the habit of it, and before I knew it I was suprisingly close to a 100 day commit streak.

I was hoping to line up my yearly commits, so I could have 1000 yearly and 100 as current streak, but by the time I thought of that I would have had to make some 20 commits per day to accomplish it. Ah well.

Overall I found it to be a valuable exercise. After the first month or so of a streak it became less of a hassle and more of a habit - where a day didn't seem quite resolved unless I knew that I had commit some code, and finding the time to write that commit came more naturally.

I think in many ways it has to do with the natural human desire for numbers to increment. The "feeling" of progress is there if you can make a magic "productivity number" go up, regardless of whether you made any meaningful progress on something or not. By tying this desire to the work you have to do, it gives a little bit of extra internal motivation to work through days where you don't really feel like giving it too much effort - it introduces a punishment for laziness, in that the streak resets and your back to square one.

I can't say that I was definitively more productive than if I hadn't tried it, but it certainly seems that was the case if I look at my commit history from before and during, not neccesarily the number of commits but the general frequency that stuff actually got done. You can't put something off for too long if you have to do *something* every day.
